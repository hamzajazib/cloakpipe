//! Transparent MCP interceptor.
//!
//! Sits between an MCP client (the agent) and an upstream MCP server, speaking
//! MCP's newline-delimited JSON-RPC in both directions. By default it forwards
//! what the agent sent: the gate allows or refuses a call, and never rewrites
//! an allowed one.
//!
//! With the opt-in PII transform ([`ProxyContext::pii`], `mcp-proxy
//! --transform pii`):
//!
//!   agent ──stdin──▶ [ mask tools/call args ] ──▶ upstream stdin
//!   agent ◀─stdout── [ rehydrate result tokens ] ◀── upstream stdout
//!
//! so PII never reaches the (possibly external) tool, and pseudonym tokens the
//! tool echoes back are restored before the agent sees them. Every masked
//! call and every result then appends a no-PII evidence-ledger hop
//! (`McpToolCall` / `McpToolResult`) — categories + counts only, never the text.
//!
//! With a gate, every decision appends one signed decision entry
//! ([`cloakpipe_ledger::decision`]) to the [`DecisionLog`]: each `tools/call`
//! (allowed, refused, approval-gated, replayed), each message refused
//! unread, and each side-effect outcome (`committed` / `failed` /
//! `unknown`). An entry is written before its call is forwarded or
//! answered; if it cannot be written, the call is refused as `fail_closed`
//! and never reaches the tool.
//!
//! The decisions live in a transport-agnostic [`Interceptor`]: a transport
//! hands it each message from the agent and from an upstream and carries
//! out the [`Action`]s it returns. [`run_proxy`] is the stdio transport, over
//! one upstream named [`DEFAULT_SERVER`].
//!
//! The pump is deliberately synchronous std I/O on two OS threads: all the work
//! (detect / mask / rehydrate / ledger append) is blocking anyway, and async
//! stdio (`tokio::io::stdin`) both buffers stdout unhelpfully and blocks runtime
//! shutdown on its background read thread.
