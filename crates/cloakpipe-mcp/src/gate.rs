//! Runtime tool gate (Phase C): may this Agent Release call this tool now?
//!
//! The gate runs on a single-file v1 manifest ([`ToolGate::from_manifest`],
//! `cloakpipe.manifest.yaml`, see [`cloakpipe_release::v1`]) or, deprecated,
//! on a legacy AgentRelease plus the ToolContracts it binds
//! ([`ToolGate::new`] + [`ToolGate::with_contracts`]). Both compile to the
//! same per-tool rules. With a v1 manifest every declared tool has rules
//! (closed by default: a tool without `args` takes no arguments); a
//! side-effecting tool's operation id comes from its `idempotency_key`
//! template when it has one, and approval can be conditional (`when`), routed
//! (`approvers`, reported in [`ToolGate::approval_request`]) and bounded
//! (`ttl`: a receipt valid for longer than that is `approval_invalid`).
//!
//! The MCP interceptor asks [`ToolGate::check`] before forwarding each
//! `tools/call`. A call is allowed only when the tool is declared in the
//! release manifest (`spec.tools`, by name: `tool:refund@4` declares
//! `refund`) and passes the tool contract that covers it, if any (below).
//! `shadow` mode reaches the same verdicts but lets calls through.
//!
//! Legacy, `certification` cargo feature only (off by default):
//! [`ToolGate::with_certification`] also requires the release to hold a
//! certification that verifies offline *now* (`cloakpipe_cert::statement::verify`:
//! trusted signer, not revoked, inside its validity window, about this
//! release, `certified` decision) for the gate's environment; without one
//! every call is refused.
//!
//! A release can also bind tool contracts (`policy:tool-contract/...` in
//! `spec.policies`, see [`cloakpipe_release::contract`]). The gate is then
//! given the contracts and the trusted task context with
//! [`ToolGate::with_contracts`], which refuses a contract the release does
//! not bind and a bound contract that was not supplied. For a tool a
//! contract covers, [`ToolGate::check`] also validates the call's raw
//! (pre-masking) arguments. Declared tools no contract covers keep the
//! behaviour above.
//!
//! A contract tool with `requiresApproval: true` also needs a signed
//! approval receipt for this exact call ([`cloakpipe_receipt::approval`]): the
//! gate computes the call's fingerprint
//! ([`cloakpipe_release::action::fingerprint`] over the raw arguments),
//! reads `<fingerprint hex>.approval.json` from the directory given to
//! [`ToolGate::with_approvals`] and verifies it against the release, the
//! tool, the task context's `taskId` and the trusted approver keys.
//! [`ToolGate::authorize`] returns the receipt's digest and operation id so
//! the call can be recorded against it.
//!
//! A contract tool with `sideEffect: true` is an *operation*
//! ([`crate::operations`]): [`ToolGate::authorize`] names it (the receipt's
//! `operationId`, else [`derive_operation_id`], keyed by the store, from the task context's
//! `taskId` and the call fingerprint) and the interceptor runs it through
//! the operations store given to [`ToolGate::with_operations`], so a call
//! whose outcome is unknown is never silently re-executed. A gate with such
//! a tool and no store is not [`ToolGate::ready`].
//!
//! A v1 manifest may reference a Cedar policy (`policy:`, see
//! [`cloakpipe_policy`]). [`ToolGate::with_policy`] parses it (an invalid
//! policy refuses to start) and gives it the persistent call counters; until
//! then the gate is not [`ToolGate::ready`] and refuses every call as
//! `fail_closed`. The decision order is contract -> Cedar -> approval: a
//! call that passes its contract is evaluated with Cedar (no satisfied
//! permit, or a satisfied forbid: `policy_denied`, with the satisfied
//! forbids' ids; any evaluation error: `fail_closed`), and needs an approval
//! receipt when the manifest's `approval:` rule holds *or* every satisfied
//! permit carries `@approval("<route>")` (its routes join the manifest's
//! `approvers`). Without `policy:`, Cedar is skipped. The interceptor
//! counts each call it forwards ([`ToolGate::record_forwarded`]) for the
//! policy's `context.counters`.
