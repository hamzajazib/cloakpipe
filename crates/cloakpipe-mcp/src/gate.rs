//! Runtime tool gate (Phase C): may this Agent Release call this tool now?
//!
//! The MCP interceptor asks [`ToolGate::check`] before forwarding each
//! `tools/call`. A call is allowed only when the tool is declared in the
//! release manifest (`spec.tools`, by name: `tool:refund@4` declares
//! `refund`) and passes the tool contract that covers it, if any (below).
//! `warn` mode reports the same verdicts but lets calls through.
//!
//! Legacy, `certification` cargo feature only (off by default):
//! [`ToolGate::with_certification`] also requires the release to hold a
//! certification that verifies offline *now* (`cloakpipe_cert::statement::verify`:
//! trusted signer, not revoked, inside its validity window, about this
//! release, `certified` decision) for the gate's environment; without one
//! every call is refused.
//!
//! A release can also bind tool contracts (`policy:tool-contract/...` in
//! `spec.policies`, see [`cloakpipe_release::contract`]). The gate is then
//! given the contracts and the trusted task context with
//! [`ToolGate::with_contracts`], which refuses a contract the release does
//! not bind and a bound contract that was not supplied. For a tool a
//! contract covers, [`ToolGate::check`] also validates the call's raw
//! (pre-masking) arguments. Declared tools no contract covers keep the
//! behaviour above.
//!
//! A contract tool with `requiresApproval: true` also needs a signed
//! approval receipt for this exact call ([`cloakpipe_receipt::approval`]): the
//! gate computes the call's fingerprint
//! ([`cloakpipe_release::action::fingerprint`] over the raw arguments),
//! reads `<fingerprint hex>.approval.json` from the directory given to
//! [`ToolGate::with_approvals`] and verifies it against the release, the
//! tool, the task context's `taskId` and the trusted approver keys.
//! [`ToolGate::authorize`] returns the receipt's digest and operation id so
//! the call can be recorded against it.
//!
//! A contract tool with `sideEffect: true` is an *operation*
//! ([`crate::operations`]): [`ToolGate::authorize`] names it (the receipt's
//! `operationId`, else [`derive_operation_id`], keyed by the store, from the task context's
//! `taskId` and the call fingerprint) and the interceptor runs it through
//! the operations store given to [`ToolGate::with_operations`], so a call
//! whose outcome is unknown is never silently re-executed. A gate with such
//! a tool and no store is not [`ToolGate::ready`].
