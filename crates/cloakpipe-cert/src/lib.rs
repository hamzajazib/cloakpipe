//! Agent Release certification (Phase B).
//!
//! - [`model`]: evaluation runs, certification policies and decisions, with
//!   canonical hashes so every input to a decision is pinned.
//! - [`import`]: turn external results (JUnit XML, Braintrust, Langfuse,
//!   native JSON) into [`model::EvaluationRun`]s.
//! - [`policy`]: the deterministic certification decision.
//! - [`statement`]: signed, scoped, expiring certification attestations
//!   (in-toto v1 in a DSSE envelope) and their offline verification.
//! - [`approval`]: signed approval receipts for one exact tool call
//!   (re-exported from `cloakpipe-receipt`, where it now lives; the DSSE
//!   items of [`statement`] are re-exported from there too).
//!
//! The contract is specified in `docs/legacy/CERTIFICATION.md`.
