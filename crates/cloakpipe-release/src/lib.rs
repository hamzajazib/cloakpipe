//! Agent Release manifests.
//!
//! An Agent Release is the complete, immutable set of behaviour-affecting
//! components deployed as one unit: code, prompts, model, parameters, tools,
//! MCP servers, retrieval, policies, runtime and dependencies. This crate
//! parses and validates manifests, computes their canonical hash, and diffs two
//! releases to decide which assurance suites a change requires.
