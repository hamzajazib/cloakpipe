# Release audit packs

A **release audit pack** is the one artefact a client's security reviewer
gets for an Agent Release: one signed JSON file with the manifest, the
evaluation evidence, the certifications, the governance history and the
runtime evidence ledger for that exact release. It verifies offline, with
no network access and no CloakPipe account.

- Rust: [`crates/cloakpipe-verify/src/pack`](../crates/cloakpipe-verify/src/pack)
  (`PackBuilder` to produce, `verify_pack_bytes` to check)
- Producer CLI: `cloakpipe release audit-pack`
- Verifier CLI: `cloakpipe-verify release-pack`

## Why one JSON file

A directory or tarball needs a manifest of its own, a rule for files that
are present but not listed, and a canonical archive encoding before it can be
signed. Every section here is already JSON (manifests, runs, DSSE envelopes,
ledger bundles), so one JSON document signed over its RFC 8785 (JCS) form
has a single canonical byte representation, opens in any tool, and leaves
nothing outside the signature. The cost is size: ledger exports are
embedded whole (see [Ledger](#ledger)).

## Format (`cloakpipe.dev/v1alpha1`, `ReleaseAuditPack`)

```json
{
  "apiVersion": "cloakpipe.dev/v1alpha1",

    "createdAt": "2026-10-07T12:00:00Z",
    "exporter": "cloakpipe-cloud:acme",

        { "type": "release_promoted", "at": "...", "actor": "alice@acme", "environment": "production",
          "fromRelease": "sha256:<hex>", "breakGlass": false, "reason": "optional" },
        { "type": "release_superseded", "at": "...", "actor": "...", "environment": "production", "toRelease": "sha256:<hex>" },

| Field | Content |
|---|---|
| `spec.release` | The manifest ([AGENT_RELEASE.md](AGENT_RELEASE.md)) and its `sha256:` hash. |
| `spec.evaluationRuns` | Native `EvaluationRun`s ([CERTIFICATION.md](CERTIFICATION.md)) of this release. |
| `spec.certifications` | DSSE envelopes from `release certify` or CloakPipe Cloud, blocked decisions included. |
| `spec.governance.events` | Control-plane history, in non-decreasing `at` order, starting with the one `release_registered`. `at` is RFC 3339; `actor` is non-empty. `environment` is exactly one of `draft`, `candidate`, `staging`, `production`, `rollback`. `fromRelease`, `reason` are optional; `breakGlass` defaults to `false`. `op` is `gt`/`lt`, `action` `alert`/`revoke`. |
| `spec.ledgerExports` | Signed `cloakpipe.bundle` v4 exports (`cloakpipe-ledger::export`), unmodified. |
| `spec.limitations` | Caveats; the builder always includes the governance limitation below. |

Every object defined by the pack rejects unknown fields; event `type` is a
closed set.

**Signing input** = `"cloakpipe.dev/release-audit-pack/v1alpha1"` ‖ `"\n"` ‖
`JCS({"apiVersion", "kind", "spec"})`. `digest` = `"sha256:"` + hex SHA-256 of
the signing input. `signature.sig` = standard base64 of the Ed25519 signature
of the signing input by the exporter key; `keyid` = `"ed25519:"` + first 16
hex chars of SHA-256(public key) (the `release keygen` key id).

## Governance events are exporter-attested only

Registrations, promotions, revocations and sentinel breaches are records of
the exporter's control plane. Nobody else signed them: the pack signature
proves the exporter vouched for them, not that `alice@acme` really pressed
the button. The pack says so (`governance.attestedBy: "exporter"`, the only
value this version accepts, and a `limitations` entry) and the verifier
prints it in every report. Certifications and ledger hops, by contrast, are
signed by their own issuers and verified against their own trust anchors:
`--cert-trust` and `--ledger-trust`, never the exporter's `--trust`, and the
verifier fails if one key is given for two roles. So the exporter cannot
certify its own production promotion, and a runtime ledger key (typically
on a less protected proxy host) cannot sign governance history.

## Verification

```
cloakpipe-verify release-pack PACK --trust KEYFILE [--ledger-trust KEYFILE] [--cert-trust KEYFILE]
                                   [--now RFC3339] [--json]
```

Each trust flag takes **one** key file (`release keygen` files;
`{"keyid", "publicKey"}` is enough, a declared `keyid` must match); repeat
the flag for more keys. One key may not appear under two flags.

- `--trust`: the exporter, whose key signs the pack. At least one is required.
- `--ledger-trust`: ledger signers (matched by public key, since ledger key
  ids are not unique). Without one, a pack with ledger exports fails.
- `--cert-trust`: certification issuers. There is no default: without one,
  no certification verifies and a non-break-glass production promotion fails.
- `--now`: verification time (default: the clock). Everything is offline.
- Exit **0** pass, **1** failed (any check below), **2** usage, an
  unreadable pack or key file, or a pack over 256 MiB (not read).
  `--json` prints the report.

Checks (all run; the report lists every failure):

1. **Document**: valid JSON, no duplicate keys, no integer beyond ±(2^53−1)
   (it has no exact JCS form), `apiVersion`/`kind` as above, no unknown
   fields.
2. **Pack signature**: `digest` recomputes; `signature` verifies under a
   `--trust` key with that `keyid`. No key is trusted for two roles.
3. **Manifest**: certifiable, and `release.hash` recomputes from it. Every
   other section is checked against the recomputed hash.
4. **Runs**: valid, `release` is this release, no duplicates.
5. **Certifications**: each verifies (`cloakpipe_cert::statement::verify`)
   against `--cert-trust` with subject = this release; `INVALID` fails the
   pack, while `EXPIRED`/`REVOKED` are reported as history. Every run a
   decision cites must be in the pack (baseline runs are not required, they
   belong to another release). No duplicate statements.
6. **Events**: in time order, not after `createdAt`, `createdAt` not after
   `now`; exactly one `release_registered`, which is the first event and
   matches the manifest's agent and version; every `environment` is one of
   the five names above, spelled exactly (`Production`, `prod` or
   `production ` fail rather than count as an environment that needs no
   certification); `fromRelease` and `toRelease` are other releases;
   `certification_revoked` names a statement in the pack, once, and not
   before that certification's `issuedAt`; `sentinel_breach.value` really
   breaches `op threshold`, `calls ≥ 1`.
7. **Promotion consistency**: a `release_promoted` into `production` needs a
   certification for `production` that is certified at that instant
   (signature, validity window, revocations up to then). Otherwise it must
   be `breakGlass: true` with a non-empty `reason`, which passes with a
   warning; anything else fails. A release still live in `production` with
   no certification valid at `now` (revoked or expired) passes with a
   warning: the history is consistent, but PASS does not mean production
   runs a certified release.
8. **Sentinel consistency**: a `sentinel_breach` with `action: revoke` must
   be matched by a `certification_revoked` event for every certification of
   its environment that was valid at the breach. The revocation may be dated
   before or after the breach (CloakPipe Cloud revokes first, and a repeat
   breach in the same window keeps the window's first time).
9. **Ledger**: each export is v4 (the manifest signs the chain tip), its chain,
   batch signatures, anchor receipts, inclusion proofs and manifest verify
   (the existing `chain`/`sigs`/`anchors`/`proofs`/`manifest` checks), its
   manifest signer is a `--ledger-trust` key, at least one hop is bound to
   this release, and no record (tenant, seq) appears in two exports.

The human summary starts with `PASS` or `FAIL`, then the release, signer,
runs, certifications, ledger, **environment status** (live/superseded, since
when, on what basis, whether a production certification is valid now) and a
**timeline** (registration, promotions, certification issuance/expiry,
revocations, sentinel breaches, first and last runtime hop).

### Ledger

A hash chain cannot be cut to one release's hops without breaking its
proof, so exports are embedded whole. The verifier reads each hop's release
binding from its signed canonical bytes and reports hops bound to this
release and the `other` hops kept for the chain.

The metadata line is the ledger's `key=type:value;` entries in strictly
increasing key order (`bool`, `int`, `hash`, `id`). `cloakpipe-ledger`
refuses metadata keys that are empty or contain whitespace, `;` or `=`, and
opaque ids that contain `;` or `=`, so a line splits into entries one way
only and an opaque id cannot spell out a forged `release_hash` entry. The
verifier parses every entry strictly and binds a hop only through the entry
whose key is exactly `release_hash`, which must be a `hash` (the same rule
as `LedgerRecord::release_hash()`); a line that does not parse fails the
pack. Records written before this rule by an older ledger could carry such
ids; they fail closed rather than being read.

Anchor receipts travel inside the exports and are verified there. The pack
itself is not anchored, and the pack has no section for separate anchor
receipts.

## Producing a pack

CLI, from local files:

```
cloakpipe release audit-pack --manifest release.yaml --run run.json... \
    --certification release.cert.dsse.json... --ledger-export ledger.json... \
    --events events.json --key exporter.key.json --out release.audit-pack.json \
    [--exporter ID] [--now RFC3339] [--limitation TEXT]...
```

`events.json` is a JSON array of events as above (any order; they are
sorted). Exit 0 written (prints the digest), 1 an input that could never
verify, 2 usage or I/O.

Rust (CloakPipe Cloud):

```rust
use cloakpipe_verify::pack::{GovernanceEvent, PackBuilder};

let pack = PackBuilder::new(manifest /* AgentRelease */, "cloakpipe-cloud:acme", created_at_rfc3339)
    .runs(runs)                       // Vec<cloakpipe_cert::EvaluationRun>
    .certifications(envelopes)        // Vec<cloakpipe_cert::statement::Envelope>
    .events(events)                   // Vec<GovernanceEvent>, any order
    .ledger_export_json(bundle_json)? // serde_json::Value of a ledger export
    .build(&signing_key)?;            // ed25519_dalek::SigningKey
let json = pack.to_json_pretty();
```

`build` refuses what could never verify (`BuildError`): an empty exporter,
an uncertifiable manifest, a run or certification for another release, a
non-RFC 3339 time or an event after `createdAt`, a ledger export without a
hop for this release or overlapping an earlier export, no
`release_registered` event (`MissingRegistration`). It does not check
certification signatures, environment names, or promotion and sentinel
consistency, which the verifier does with its trust anchors.

Verifying from Rust:

```rust
use cloakpipe_verify::pack::{verify_pack_bytes, VerifyOptions};

let report = verify_pack_bytes(&bytes, &VerifyOptions {
    trusted: vec![exporter],        // pack signature
    ledger_trusted: vec![ledger],   // ledger export signers
    cert_trusted: vec![issuer],     // certification issuers
    now: chrono::Utc::now(),
});
```

## What a pack does not prove

- That governance events happened as recorded (exporter-attested only).
- That the pack is complete: an exporter can leave out runs,
  certifications, events or whole ledger exports. A ledger export is
  complete only up to its own signed chain tip.
- That revocations were issued by anyone but the exporter: this version has
  no signed revocation-statement format, so a revocation is an
  exporter-attested `certification_revoked` event (as are sentinel
  breaches). The verifier cannot be given extra revoked statements or keys.
- When the pack was made: it is not anchored (no transparency-log or TSA
  receipt over the pack digest). Anchor receipts exist only inside the
  embedded ledger exports and cover those exports, not the pack.
- That ledger hop times fall inside the governance history: hop timestamps
  are not compared with `createdAt` or with the promotions.
- Anything the included certifications do not claim (see
  [CERTIFICATION.md](CERTIFICATION.md#what-a-certification-does-not-claim)).
